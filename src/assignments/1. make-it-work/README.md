# Make it work

This assignment is fairly straight forward. Starting from the `math` file, your goal is to write test suites for each of the functions. Keep in mind to start with writing a test suite for the expected behaviours of the function, which would likely fail, then write the implementation to pass your tests.


### Order:
1. math
2. filtering
3. branching with test coverage
4. run all tests

### Commands
```bash
yarn test math 
yarn test filtering
yarn test branching
yarn test make-it-work

```
